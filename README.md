Delivered exercise. CRM - OOP Homework (Unit 2) (IRONHACK)

Welcome to the ultimate CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. CRMs are a tool that almost every sales team uses to track prospective and existing customers through the sales process.

This CRM allows us to:

- Track Leads
- Convert Leads into Opportunities
- Associate an Opportunity with an Account.
- Associate Contacts with an Opportunity.

Leads, Contacts, Opportunities and Accounts are stored in a GitHub repository so you never loose information from your beloved customers. You also get your local copy of your updates.

## Requirements

First of all you need to clone the code and include the Access Token that we have sent you so your updates become persistent in a remote repository. The Access Token needs to be pasted in the field 'JAVA_APP_PASSWORD' in the resources/config.properties file.

After that you have two options to run the code:
- Option 1: You need to have IntelliJ in your local system to clone this repository and run it.
- Option 2: Alternatively, you can build a Docker image by using the Dockerfile included in the repository and run your own image.

## Usage

You just need to type the command you need, press ENTER and follow the given instructions.
